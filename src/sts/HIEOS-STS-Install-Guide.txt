NOTE: We believe there may be a "conflict" with other libraries when using endorsed as stated below.  So, to be safe,
please install STS in its own separate Glassfish domain folling the instructions below.  Also, need to start with 
a properly deployed axis2.war.


0. Install sts.aar into targeted Glassfish domain (referenced as <glassfish_domain_root> here).  You should see
   a failure in the system log (look for "Initializing OpenSAML library") when exercising STS web service interface.
1. Copy <hieos_root>\hieos\lib\opensaml\endorsed\*.* to <glassfish_domain_root>\lib\endorsed\*.*
2. Configure Glassfish
   a) go to Application Server->JVM Settings->JVM Options
   b) Set "java.endorsed.dirs" to the following:
      -Djava.endorsed.dirs=${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/lib/endorsed${path.separator}${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/lib/endorsed
3) Restart Glassfish
4) Failure in Step 0 above should go away when exercising STS web service interface. In the system
   log, you should see "Initializing OpenSAML library - Success!"
